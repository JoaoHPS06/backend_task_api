Welcome to my backend development study repository! This project documents my learning journey, guided by Gemini AI, following a roadmap from basic to advanced concepts.

The repository contains two implementations of the same Task Management API, each exploring a different database paradigm.

## Projects

1.  **[API with Flask and PostgreSQL](./gerenciador_tarefas/):** A complete RESTful implementation using a relational database (SQL).
2.  **[API with Flask and MongoDB](./gerenciador_tarefas_mongo/):** A re-implementation of the same API using a document database (NoSQL).

## Technologies and Concepts Covered

This journey covered the pillars of modern backend development, including:

-   **Language:** Python
-   **Framework:** Flask
-   **Databases:** PostgreSQL (Relational) & MongoDB (NoSQL)
-   **Security:** JWT Authentication, Password Hashing, Ownership-based Authorization.
-   **Testing:** Unit and Integration Testing with Pytest and Mocks.
-   **Architecture:** REST Principles, Asynchronous Programming, Queues, Caching, Load Balancing, Resiliency.
-   **DevOps:** Containerization with Docker and Gunicorn.
